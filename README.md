To clone the project in this repo and run it locally:

You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.

As an example: in the .env-file_name_here file, write PGDATABASE=database_name_here
